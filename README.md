According to the SGD genome database, the gene UTP22 is from the yeast genome and is required for the nuclear export of tRNAs and may facilitate binding of Utp8p to aminoacylated tRNAs and their delivery to Los1p for export. Based on the information from the NCBI Blast UTP 22 is most probably a rRNA processing protein from the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
