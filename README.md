# Yeast-Gene-Project
According to the SGD genome database, the gene UTP22 is from the yeast genome and is required for the nuclear export of tRNAs and may facilitate binding of Utp8p to aminoacylated tRNAs and their delivery to Los1p for export. Based on the information from the NCBI Protein Blast UTP 22 is most probably a rRNA processing protein from the yeast strain Saccharom. yces cerevisiae. Based on the NCBI Nucleotide Blast UTP 22 belongs to chromosome seven of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ySR127. When I compared the protein sequencewith the nucleotide human genome blast the result was a 189 allignment score with Homo sapiens nucleolar RNA-associated protein beta mRNA.
